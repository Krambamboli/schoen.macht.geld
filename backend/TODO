## Ideas

* [ ] Win/loss for right/let swipe depends on price, randomness (maybe swipe history?)
* [ ] Initial price is defined by game or something interactive
* [ ] Random stock movement
* [ ] Simulate real life stock market events like financial crisis, crash, extreme swings where even right swiping loses money and other situations with the opposite
